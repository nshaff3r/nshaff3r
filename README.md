## Hello, World! 👋😁

I'm a junior at UChicago studying computer science and [Fundamentals](https://college.uchicago.edu/academics/fundamentals-students).

- 💡 I'm passionate about humanities, arts, and using tech to support other disciplines.
- 📰 I cover and edit arts for the [Chicago Maroon](https://chicagomaroon.com/).
- 🌱 I started the [UChicago Alt Protein Project](https://gfi.org/directory/the-uchicago-alt-protein-project/) and am excited about building a better food system.
- 💬 I'd love to talk about any of these things! You can reach me at nolanshaffer (at) uchicago (dot) edu.
